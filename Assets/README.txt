THEME: Share knowledge


TITLE: The Librarian's Wracky Knowledge Ride

You are a librarian who lives in another realm known as 'The Other Collection'. You have to run around and collect coloured blobs of knowledge which you can fire at hostile entities known as the 'Ignorant Ones'

However, if you don't match the coloured blob with the enemy then you will take knowledge damage, you also lose knowledge if you get melee'd.

The game should be designed to be a fast paced parkour style game, basically a family friendly DOOM game.
